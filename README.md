## Requirements
- random
- json
- urllib

## How it works
Every time you send words to a Wordcloud on Mentimeter, your client will send a GET request to https://www.menti.com/core/vote-keys/MENTI_ID/series
<br>This request returns:
```json
{
   "id":"MENTI_ID",
   "vote_key":"VOTE_KEY",
   "name":"My First Presentation",
   "visible":true,
   "tags":null,
   "theme_id":19009,
   "owner_id": 000000,
   "pace":{
      "mode":"presenter",
      "active":"UNIQUE_ID"
   },
}
```

The ``Unique ID`` is needed to create the URL of the POST request.
<br> To add words to Wordcloud on Mentimeter a POST request is sent to the following URL: https://www.menti.com/core/votes/UNIQUE_ID
<br>
This will include the following header:
```json
{
  "question_type": "wordcloud",
  "vote": "cool1 cool2 cool3"
}

```
Mentimeter, meanwhile, has built in protection against bots like these. This protection works via the so-called ``ÌDENTIFIER``.
Fortunately, it is very easy to bypass this protection.
<br><br>
We simply send a POST request to: https://www.menti.com/core/identifiers
with the following header:

```json
{"user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.159 Safari/537.36"}
```
And voila, Mentimeter returned us an identifier that we can use further. With each new word added, the identifier is regenerated by the script to ensure that each request is counted!

With that, we're almost done. To finish, we send a POST request to https://www.menti.com/core/votes/IDENTIFIER with the following header: 
```json
"user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.159 Safari/537.36",
"x-identifier": "IDENTIFIER"
```
And with that, the word(s) would be added, and the script takes a new identifier and continues to add all the words.

## Threading
This repo uses threads to increase performance.<br>
Too many threads could slow down your network or PC.<br>
I recommend not to use more than 50 threads at the same time!

## Errors
If Menti has fixed this script, or you get other errors please report them [here](https://github.com/Primexz/Menti_Spammer-Py/issues) so I can fix them!
